## Redesign of Pink Panther Fast Food Website in Crikvenica

The Fast Food Pink Panther Crikvenica website is a medium-sized, passion-driven project through which I started learning Vue.js and wanted to showcase my creativity. Additionally, it was created in response to the client's need for a redesign of their existing website.

The website was built as a **Single Page Application**, using the latest **Vue.js 3** with the **Composition API**, **Bootstrap 5.0.2** for design, **Leaflet** - a JavaScript library for interactive maps, and **Vue I18n** - an internationalization plugin for Vue.js.

Initially, the website was designed specifically for mobile devices, but later it was adapted for desktop and tablet devices as well.

The website design follows modern web design principles, such as font scaling, spacing between elements and texts, and various other aspects. The appearance resembles more of a restaurant's website rather than a fast food website, but that was intentional as it suited their cultural requirements.

A personalized style guide was also created for the website as part of the learning process. The style guide can be found in `/info/Fast Food Pink Panther Crikvenica Style Guide.pptx`.
